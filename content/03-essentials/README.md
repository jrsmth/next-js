# Next.js Essentials

<br>

## File-based Routing
* The folder structure of your project (under `/app`) dictates the routing of your application
    * `page.js` / `page.tsx` is a reserved filename that tells Next.js to create a route using the parent folder's name
        * Example:  `/app/login/page.tsx` creates a route at `/login` and serves the corresponding `page.tsx` file
    * `page.*` files are React component:
        * Example:
            ```typescript
                export default function Home() {
                    return (
                        <main>
                        <img src="/logo.png" alt="A server surrounded by magic sparkles." />
                        <h1>Welcome to this NextJS Course!</h1>
                        <p>ðŸ”¥ Let&apos;s get started! ðŸ”¥</p>
                        </main>
                    );
                }
            ```
* Dynamic Routing:
    * Creating sub-directories using the naming convention `[<PARAMETER_NAME>]` will create dynamic routes
    * Example:
        * A `/app/blog/[id]/page.tsx` folder structure will create a route for `/app/blog/{id}`
        ```typescript
            export default function BlogPostPage() {
                return(
                    <main>
                        <h1>Blog {params.id}</h1>
                    </main>
                )
            }
        ```
        * Note: the `params` variable is an object that stores the parameter supplied in the dynamic router
* In the Angular world, we think of our app as being comprised in terms of components (e.g `LoginComponent`):
  * When coming over to Next.js, we should start thinking of our apps in terms of routes (e.g `/login`)

<br>

## Navigation
* Next.js provides a `<Link>` component that should be used for navigating between `page.*`'s
    * This enables our app to leaverage the prerendering advantages of SSR but also be a modern reactive SPA after the initial page load
* Example:
    ```typescript
        <Link href='about-us'>About Us</Link>
    ```

<br>

## Server vs Client Components
```typescript
    export default function Home() {
        console.log('Output something');
        return (
            <main>
            <img src="/logo.png" alt="A server surrounded by magic sparkles." />
            <h1>Welcome to this NextJS Course!</h1>
            <p>ðŸ”¥ Let&apos;s get started! ðŸ”¥</p>
            </main>
        );
    }
```
* This component is by default a Server component, meaning that it is rendered on the server and not the client
    * As a result, the `console.log()` outputted in the server logs and not in the browser
* If we wanted this to be a Client component, we would add the `'use client'` directive to the top of the component file
  * Ex: we would want to use a client component when using the `onClick` mechanism, as this would not be available on the server
  * It is best-practise to use `'use client'` as far down the component tree as possible in order to maximise the optimisations provided by server components

<br>

## Layout
* Within each component folder, the `layout.*` file is reserved for defining the shell around one or more pages
    * It defines the layout into which a `page.*` will be rendered
* Every Next.js project requires at least one `layout.*` in the root `/app` folder but nested ones can be used in your components
    * Example:
        ```typescript
            import './globals.css'

            export const metadata = {
                title: 'NextJS Course App',
                description: 'Your first NextJS app!',
            };

            export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
                return (
                    <html lang="en">
                        <body>{children}</body>
                    </html>
                );
            }
        ```
        * Note: 
            * `metadata` is a reserved variable, available throughout an app, for implicitly injecting properties into the `<header>`
            * `children` refers to the template of the corresponding `page.*` file in this component

<br>

## Favicon
* In the root `/app` folder, the reserved `icon.png` file represents the application favicon

<br>

## Regular (Non-Page) Components
* We can still break our pages down into reusable components
* We do this by creating standard react components, placed in files named using the component name
    * Typically, these would be placed in a `/app/components` but the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation) discuss other recommendations
* Example:
    ```typescript
        export default function Header() {
            return (
                <>
                    <h1>App Name</h1>
                </>
            )
        }
    ```
    * Note: `import Header from '@/components/header';` can be used to import the fragment in other components
        * Where the `@` refers to our root `/app` directory

<br>

## Styling
* Options:
  * `globals.css`
  * TailwindCSS:
    * Pre-defined class names are applied to html elements to leverage generic styles
  * CSS Modules:
    * Standard CSS code that is scoped to a particular component is place next to the component javascript
      * Example: `Login.module.css`
    * This module is imported into our component and is referenced to link class-names and ids to html elements

<br>

## Images
* Next.js provides an `<Image>` component which offers optimisations (such as lazy-loading)
  * It is best-practise to use this component rather than the standard `<img>` element
