## What is Next.js
* Next.js is a framework that is built on top of the React library
* Its purpose is to simplify fullstack development by blending frontend and backend into one project
* Website SEO (search engine optimisation) is a key benefit of Next.js, that is provided by SSR:
    * With server-side rendering (SSR), pages are pre-rendered on the server, rather than just on the client
    * This enables search engine crawlers to access the webpage content for indexing
