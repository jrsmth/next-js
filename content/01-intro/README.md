# Introduction

## What is Next.js
* Next.js is a framework that is built on top of the React library
* Its purpose is to simplify fullstack development by blending frontend and backend into one project
* Website SEO (search engine optimisation) is a key benefit of Next.js, that is provided by SSR:
    * With server-side rendering (SSR), pages are pre-rendered on the server, rather than just on the client
    * This enables search engine crawlers to access the webpage content for indexing

## New App
* Create app : `npx create-next-app@latest <APP-NAME>`
    * Replacing `<APP-NAME>` with `.` creates the app in the current directory
* Start app  : `npm run dev`

## Pages Router vs App Router
* The Pages and App Router are two different ways of handling router in Next.js
* Pages Router has existed for longer and is considered a stable choice
* App Router is the modern recommendation that was introduced with Next.js version 13
